# NUMBER_PLATE_DETECTION
This project is a real-time computer vision application that detects vehicle number plates from a live webcam feed and extracts the license number using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It uses OpenCV for image processing and a Haar Cascade classifier for no plate detection, followed by Tesseract OCR to recognize the characters on the plate.
